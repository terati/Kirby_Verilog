# ECE385_Final_Project
Do not plagiarize.

Our project for ECE385 is a basic Kirby game. This project was written in System Verilog and we used a DE2-115 board. Our timeframe for this project was just under a month. There are animations for movement of Kirby and the enemies. Upon staring, Kirby is loaded into a right/left scrollable world. There is one basic enemy on the startup. Upon coming into range to the door on the top, Kirby enters into the boss room. We didn't have time to fully define our health system. 

The keyboard interfaces with the NIOS system and written in C. This code was mostly provided to use but we made some minor adjustments to enable a maximum of 4 simulataneous keypresses.
